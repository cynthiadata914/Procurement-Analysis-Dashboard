## Goal

The goal of this dashboard is to track procurement spend,evaluate high-performing product categories,and explore how discounts and delivery methods influence profitability. It was developed as part of my learning and portfolio-building journey in supply chain data analytics.

## Visuals and Insights

|Delivery Status by Shipping Mode| Shows delivery success or delay across shipping mewthods|
|Profit vs Discount| Examines the relationship betweendiscount rates and profitability|

## Data Cleaning

- I removed blank and duplicate rows.
- I converted order and shipping dates to proper formats.
- I created new calculated fields:
 - Processing Time
 - Profit Margin
 - Shipping Day(Day of the week).
-Filtered for relevant columns to keep analysis focused and clear.

## Key Insights

- The **Fan Shop** and **Apparel** departments had the highest total procurement spend.
- **Product profitability** and **sales volume** dont always align,some low-volume items have higher margins.
- **First Class shipping** had the lowest percentage of late deliveries.
- Regions offering high discounts did not necessarily yield high profits.

## Tools Used

- **Excel**
- **PowerBI**
